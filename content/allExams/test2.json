Each correct answer fetches 3 marks, while each incorrect answer has a penalty of 1 mark (-1mark). No marks are awarded for questions not attempted. While the candidate can skip a question, the computer will not allow the candidate to choose more than one option as correct answer. </span></li><li><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.1px; line-height: 1.846;\">There will be 150 questions in all.
